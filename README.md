## Description

We developed pancreatic cancer therapy using modifying the T-cells to specifically target the pancreatic cancer cells in a biomimetic tumor microenvironment. Analyzing the tumor structure in 3D & 2D models helped us better understand the disease and led us one step closer to developing therapies. The imaging analysis and quantification was conducted using ImageJ, GraphPad Prism & R.
